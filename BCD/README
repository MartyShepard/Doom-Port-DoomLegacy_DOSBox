BCD v1.4 - Brennan Underwood's CD audio playing library for DJGPP.

System requirements:
* DJGPP compatible system (i.e. 386, 1 meg memory etc.)
  If you do not know what DJGPP is, run, don't walk to
    http://www.delorie.com/
  and/or
    http://brennan.home.ml.org/djgpp/
* MSCDEX 2.1 or higher
  MSCDEX should have come with your DOS setup and/or the CD-ROM driver disk.
* One or more CD-ROM drives capable of audio (aren't they all?)

Instructions:
To make BCD, just type 'make'. libbcd.a and bcd.exe (standalone cheesy
demo) will be compiled for you automagically. Then copy libbcd.a and bcd.h
to your lib and include directories.
